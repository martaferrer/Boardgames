# Boardgames

This is the Capstopne ptoject of the Data Science Nanodegree program offered by Udacity. This project is a gathering of some of the topics learned during this course. 
The goal of this repository is to create a Boardgames dataframe from a url, clean and visualize data, and finally to apply some machine learning algorithms to predict the average rating of a game depending on its features. 

## Introduction

It is devided into the following chapters:
1. Extract data
1.1. Websire scraping using BeautifulSoup and request libraries to extract information from the BoardgamesGeeks webpage. 
1.2. Structure code as to create a pipy package.
1.3. the code using and inherintance classes
1.4. Use object-oriented programming
2. Transform data
2.1. Clean data: find missing and repetitive values 
2.2. Get categorical data
2.3. Data visualization
3. Boardgames recommendations
3.1. Ranked-recommender
3.2. Knowledge-based recommender
3.3. TODO: Collaborative filtering
5. Machine Leaning: Game rating prediciton
6.1. Use 
7. Explain your findings with others
7.1. Create a new Medium blog

## Structure

As mentioned before, the project is structure as a python package:
